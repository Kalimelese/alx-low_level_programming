this is a project in Variables, if, else, while in low level programming
0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing => This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program.
1. The last digit => This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game => Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden), All your code should be in the main function
3. alphABET => Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) ,All your code should be in the main function
4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off => Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Print all the letters except q and e ,You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) ,All your code should be in the main function
